# Unwind - AutoHotKey

I very much miss the hotkeys on Mac that can be used to naviagte the Finder.  

The following hotkeys are implemented via AutoHotKey, allowing faster Explorer navigation: 

    1. Go to Home Folder (Alt-Shift-H)
    2. Go to Applications Folder (Alt-Shift-A)
    3. Go up a folder (Alt-Shift-Up Arrow)
